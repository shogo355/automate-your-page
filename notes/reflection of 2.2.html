 				<h3 class="idea">What is a variable in Python?</h3>
 				<p>
 					Variable can be used to create a name and use that name to refer to a variable(value). 
 				</p>
 				<HR align="center" width="90%">
 				<h3 class="idea">What does it mean to assign a value to a variable? How do you do it?</h3>
 				<p>
 					Assign a value means, to introduce a variable.For example, when you name "weight_of_carbon_per_mol" and 12 as its value. You could write
            <div class="eq"><!--a box for examples of assign variables-->
            weight_of_carbon_per_mol=12
              </div>
          This case value 12 was assigned to name "weight_of_carbon_per_mol".The way of introducing a variable as above is called assignment statement.
 				</p>
 				<HR align="center" width="90%">
 				<h3 class="idea">What's the difference between what the equals sign = means in 2+3=5 and my_variable=5?</h3>
 				<p>
 					In Python "=" means assignment. It works like an arrow. An arrow that says put any value on the right side, the name on the left side. So for "=" in "2+3=5" means it is even, but for "=" in "my_variable=5" means my_variable takes the value of 5 at this moment. It is only at this moment because variable can vary.
 				</p>
 				<HR align="center" width="90%">
  				<h3 class="idea">What are some ways that variables are useful?</h3>
 				<p>
 					Variables are useful as following reasons:
          <li>Using variables can avoid repetition of complicated values</li>
          <li>They can keep the results of the assignments</li>
          <li>The value of the variable can be changed by a new assignment simultaneously (check the example below)</li>
            <div class="eq"><!--a box for examples of the value changed by an assignment-->
            my_variable=5 
            <br>
            my_variable=my_variable+5
            <br>
            <span class="comment">(Once new assignemnt was made, my_variable become 10 but no longer 5)</span>
              </div>

 				</p>
				<HR align="center" width="90%">
  				<h3 class="idea">What is the difference between 2+2 and "2"+"2"?</h3>
 				<p>
 					Any value or word that are between double quotation mark become a <b>string</b> in Python. Being <b>string</b> means it is considered as a block of text that cannot be changed like variable.(i.e. They are in different rule from variable)
          When you look at 2+2, these two 2s are variable, so the result will be 4. However, when you look at "2"+"2", these "2"s are string. For strings <b>+</b> means concatenation. This will just connect the two strings together. Thereby, the result will be "22".
